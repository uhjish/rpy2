rnumpy
======

The :mod:`rnumpy` interface builds on :mod:`rpy2.rinterface`
and offers a different interface to the one in :mod:`rpy2.robjects`.

Users familiar with :mod:`numpy` and with working in interactive sessions 
with *ipython* will want to have a look at it.

More details can be found on the 
`rnumpy page <http://bitbucket.org/njs/rnumpy/wiki/Home>`_
