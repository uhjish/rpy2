Documentation for rpy2
======================


.. ifconfig:: release.endswith('dev')

   .. warning::
      This documentation describe the rpy2 package version |version| on |today|.
      The API is still changing with time, but snapshots should be good enough
      for a number of applications. This is believed to be already better than the 
      released 2.0.x branch.
      
      Although care is taken to keep the development branch functional
      at all times, and this documentation up-to-date, temporary issues may appear:
      please remember that this is software under development.
