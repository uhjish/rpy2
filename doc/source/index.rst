Documentation for rpy2
======================


This document describes RPy2, a rewrite of
the RPy package.

It is developped for R-2.7 (and is not expected to work
with a previous version), together with Python 2.5. Compatibility
with Python 2.4 is expected but it was observed to segfault on rare occasions
(and the cause is not yet identified).
