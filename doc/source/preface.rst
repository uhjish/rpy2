Preface
=======

This presentation describes RPy2, a rewrite of
the RPy package.

It is developped for R-2.7 (and is not expected to work
with a previous version), together with Python 2.5. Compatibility
with Python 2.4 is expected but not tested when writing
those lines.

Acknowledgements go to:

Walter Moreira, and Gregory Warnes
    For the original RPy and its maintainance through the years.
 
Alexander Belopolsky. 
    The contributed code of Alexander Belopolsky, who contributed
    a first rewrite to RPy is acknowledged. I have found great
    inspiration in reading that code.
