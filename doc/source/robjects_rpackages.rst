R packages
==========

Importing R packages
--------------------

In R, objects can be bundled into packages for distribution.
In similar fashion to Python modules, the packages can be installed,
and then loaded when their are needed. This is achieved by the R
functions *library()* and *require()* (attaching the namespace of
the package to the R `search path`).

.. code-block:: python

   from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
   utils = importr("utils")

The object :obj:`utils` is now a namespace object, in the sense that
its :attr:`__dict__` contains keys corresponding to the R symbols.
For example the R function *data()* can be accessed like:

>>> utils.data
<SignatureTranslatedFunction - Python:0x913754c / R:0x943bdf8>

Unfortunately, accessing an R symbol can be a little less straightforward
as R symbols can contain characters that are invalid in Python symbols.
Anyone with experience in R can even add there is a predilection for
the dot (*.*).

In an attempt to address this, during the import of the package a
translation of the R symbols is attempted, with dots becoming underscores.
This is not unlike what could be found in :mod:`rpy`, but with distinctive
differences: 

- The translation is performed once, when the package is imported,
  and the results cached. The caching allows us to perform the check below.

- A check that the translation is not masking other R symbols in the package
  is performed (e.g., both 'print_me' and 'print.me' are present).
  Should it happen, a :class:`rpy2.robjects.packages.LibraryError` is raised.
  To avoid this, use the optional argument *robject_translations*
  in the function :func:`importr`.
  .. code-block:: python

     d = {'print.me': 'print_dot_me', 'print_me': 'print_uscore_me'}
     thatpackage = importr('thatpackage', robject_translations = d)

- Thanks to the namespace encapsulation,
  translation is restricted to one package, limiting the risk
  of masking when compared to rpy translating relatively blindly and 
  retrieving the first match


.. _robjects-packages-evildot:

.. note:: 

   There has been (sometimes vocal) concerns over the seemingly unnecessary
   trouble with not translating blindly '.' into '_' for all R symbols in
   packages, as rpy was doing it.

   Fortunately the R development team is providing 
   a real-life example in R's standard library 
   (the /recommended packages/) to demonstrate the point a final time: the
   R package `tools` contains a function `package.dependencies`
   and a function `package_dependencies`, with different behaviour,
   signatures, and documentation pages.

   If using :mod:`rpy2.robjects.packages`, we leave how to resolve this
   up to you. One way is to do:

   .. code-block:: python

     d = {'package_dependencies': 'package_dot_dependencies',
          'package_dependencies': 'package_uscore_dependencies'}
     tools = importr('tools', robject_translations = d)

The translation of '.' into '_' is clearly not sufficient, as
R symbols can use a lot more characters illegal in Python symbols.
Those more exotic symbols can be accessed through :attr:`__dict__`.
   
Example:

>>> utils.__dict__['?']
<Function - Python:0x913796c / R:0x9366fac>

In addition to the translation of robjects symbols,
objects that are R functions see their named arguments translated as similar way
(with '.' becoming '_' in Python).

>>> base = importr('base')
>>> base.scan._prm_translate
{'blank_lines_skip': 'blank.lines.skip',
 'comment_char': 'comment.char',
 'multi_line': 'multi.line',
 'na_strings': 'na.strings',
 'strip_white': 'strip.white'}

Importing arbitrary R code as a package
---------------------------------------

R packages are not the only way to distribute code. From this
author's experience there exists R code circulating as .R files.

This is most likely not a good thing, but as a Python developers
this also what you might be given with the task to implement an
application (such a web service) around that code. In most working
places you will not have the option to refuse the code until
it is packaged; fortunately rpy2 is trying to make this situation
as simple as possible.

It is possible to take R code in a string, such as for example
the content of a .R file and wrap it up as an rpy2 R package.
If you are given various R files, it is possible to wrap all
of them into their own package-like structure, making concerns such conflicting
names in the respective files unnecessary.



.. code-block:: r

   square <- function(x) {
       return(x^2)
   }

   cube <- function(x) {
       return(x^3)
   }

.. code-block:: python

   string = """
   square <- function(x) {
       return(x^2)
   }

   cube <- function(x) {
       return(x^3)
   }
   """

   powerpack = SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage(string, "powerpack")

The R functions `square` and `cube` can be called with `powerpack.square()`
and `powerpack.cube`.

Package-less R code can be accessible from an URL, and some R users
will just source it from the URL. A recent use-case is to source
files from a code repository (for example GitHub).

Using a `snippet on stackoverflow`_:

.. code-block:: r

   library(devtools)
   source_url('https://raw.github.com/hadley/stringr/master/R/c.r')

.. _snippet on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7715723/sourcing-r-script-over-https

.. note::

   If concerned about computer security, you'll want to think about 
   the origin of the code and to which level you trust the origin
   to be what it really is.

Python has utilities to read data from URLs.


.. code-block:: python

   import urllib2
   from rpy2.robjects.packages import SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage

   bioc_url = urllib2.urlopen('https://raw.github.com/hadley/stringr/master/R/c.r')
   string = ''.join(bioc_url.readlines())

   stringr_c = SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage(string, "stringr_c")

The object `stringr_c` encapsulates the funtions defined in the R file
into something like what the rpy2 `importr` is returning.

>>> type(stringr_c)
rpy2.robjects.packages.SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage
>>> stringr_c._rpy2r.keys()
['str_join', 'str_c']

Unlike the R code first shown, this is not writing anything into the 
the R global environment.

>>> from rpy2.robjects import globalenv
>>> globalenv.keys()
()

R namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In R, a `namespace` is describing something specific in which symbols can be
exported, or kept internal. A lot of recent R packages are declaring a
namespace but this is not mandatory, although recommended in some R
development circles.

Namespaces and the ability to control the export of symbols
were introduced several years ago in R and were probably meant
to address the relative lack of control on symbol encapsulation an R
programmer has. Without it importing a package is in R is like
systematically writing `import *` on all packages and modules used in Python,
that will predictably create potential problems as the number
of packages used is increasing.

Since Python does not generally have the same requirement by default,
:func:`importr` exposes all objects in an namespace, 
no matter they are exported or not.

Finding where an R symbol is coming from
----------------------------------------

Knowing which object is effectively considered when a given symbol
is resolved can be of much importance in R, as the number of packages
attached grows and the use of the namespace accessors "::" and ":::" 
is not so frequent.

The function :func:`wherefrom` offers a way to find it:

>>> import rpy2.robjects.packages as rpacks
>>> env = rpacks.wherefrom('lm')
>>> env.do_slot('name')[0]
'package:stats'


.. note::

   This does not generalize completely, and more details regarding
   environment, and packages as environment should be checked
   Section :ref:`rinterface-sexpenvironment`.

Installing/removing R packages
------------------------------

R is shipped with a set of *recommended packages* 
(the equivalent of a standard library), but there is a large
(and growing) number of other packages available.

Installing those packages must be done within R, see the R documentation.
As a quick help, installing an R package can be done by

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo R

And then in the R console:

.. code-block:: r

   install.packages('foo')
