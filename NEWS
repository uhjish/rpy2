New features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.rlike`:

- package for R-like features in Python

- module :mod:`rpy2.rlike.container` with the class :class:`NamedList`.


:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- method :meth:`named`, corresponding to R's C-level NAMED

- experimental methods :meth:`frame` and :meth:`enclos` for SexpEnvironment corresponding to R's C-level FRAME and ENCLOS

Bugs fixed
----------

- R stack checking is disabled (no longer crashes when multithreading)

- Fixed missing R_PreserveObject for vectors (causing R part of the object to sometimes vanish during garbage collection)

- Prevents calling an R function when R has been ended (raise :class:`RuntimeException`).


Release 2.0.0a1
===============

New features
------------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- method :meth:`getnames` for :class:`RVector`

- experimental methods :meth:`__setitem__` and :meth:`setnames` for :class:`RVector`

- method 'getnames' for :class:`RArray`

- new class :class:`RFormula`

- new helper class :class:`RVectorDelegator` (see below)

- indexing RVector the "R way" with subset is now possible through a delegating attribute (e.g., myvec.r[True] rather than myvec.subset(True)). #suggested by Michael Sorich

- new class :class:`RDataFrame`. The constructor :meth:`__init__` is still experimental (need for an ordered dictionnary, that will be in before the beta

- filled documentation about mapping between objects

Changes
-------

- many fixes and additions to the documentation

- improved GTK console in the demos

- changed the major version number to 2 in order to avoid confusion with rpy 1.x # Suggested by Peter and Gregory Warnes

- moved test.py to demos/example01.py

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- changed method name `getNames` to `getnames` where available (all lower-case names for methods seems to be the accepted norm in Python).


Bugs fixed
----------

:mod:`rpy2.robjects`:

- Fixed string representation of R object on Microsoft Windows (using fifo, not available on win32)

- :meth:`__getattr__` for :class:`RS4` is now using :meth:`ri2py` 

:mod:`rpy2.rinterface`:

- fixed context of evaluation for R functions (now R_GlobalEnv)

Release 1.0a0
