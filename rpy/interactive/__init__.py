"""
Package to interface with R, with a focus on interactive usage
(REPL approach to code-writing), although the package will work
in non-interactive settings.

The package aims at being simple rather than exhaustively complete
(rpy2.robjects, or rpy2.rinterface, can be used if needed), providing
a comfortable experience with autocompletion-capable python consoles.
